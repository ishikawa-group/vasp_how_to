# VASP how to
## Introduction
* This repository is for those who want to learn the DFT (density functional theory) calculations using VASP.
* VASP stands for Vienna ab initio simulation package, and it is the software package to do the DFT calculation with plane-wave basis set.
* For beginners in the DFT to do VASP, learn by the following order

* The `test` directory contains input files for a simple VASP calculaiton. You can use it to check your VASP compiation is correctly done or not.
These examples are selected from VASP wiki.
